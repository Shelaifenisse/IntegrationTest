# IntegrationTest

Integration Test is a repo used to test the Poulpio App. 
The issues and Pull request here are faked but we use them to test our GitHub and Slack Integrations 
by redelivering https://github.com/organizations/PoulpIO/settings/apps/poulpio/advanced#delivery-request requests as needed.
